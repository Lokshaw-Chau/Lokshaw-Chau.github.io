Hi！I’m an undergraduate student at the department of computer science, Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT), Shenzhen. My research interests lie in transfer learning and machine learning. 

Currently I'm working with [Prof.Xiuchen Li](https://xiucheng.org/contact.html) and [Prof. Xinyang Chen](https://chenxinyang123.github.io/) and focus on domain adaptation and its application on time series analysis. 

I will graduate in June 2024 and I am **earnestly** seeking a Mphil/PhD position for Fall 2024 admission and beyond.
