I am a junior student in College of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology(Shenzhen campus). I am currently pursuing my B. Eng. , and will graduate in June, 2024. I am **EAGERLY** looking for a graduate position for 2024 Fall.

My general research interest lies in transfer learning and data mining. To be specific, I focus on domain adaptation and apply related transfer learning mechanism to time series analysis. 

I am currently working with Prof. [Xinyang Chen](https://chenxinyang123.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiucheng Li](https://xiucheng.org/contact.html) on domain adaptation for time series classification.
