Hi！I’m an undergraduate student at the department of computer science, Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT), Shenzhen. 

My research interests lie in transfer learning and machine learning. Currently I'm working with [Prof.Xiucheng Li](https://xiucheng.org/contact.html) and [Prof. Xinyang Chen](https://chenxinyang123.github.io/) on domain adaptation and its application in time series analysis. In a broader sense, I sincerely hope that my work can tap into the potential of each model thus enhance the robustness and transferbility of AI technique.

I will graduate in June 2024 and I am **earnestly** seeking a Mphil/PhD position for Fall 2024 admission and beyond.
