Hi！I’m a first year graduate student at the department of computer science, Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT), Shenzhen, supervised by [Prof.Miao Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangmiao) I also obtained bachelor's degree there. During my undergraduate study, I was grateful to intern at Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data(SRIBD) where I participated in the development of [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion), with [Prof.Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/).

My research interests lie in data-centric AI which aims at enhancing AI systems in terms of data rather than model architecture. Broadly speaking, I aspire for my research to gain insights into the nature of neural networks and to utilize them to construct intelligent systems with a model-data feedback loop that evolves autonomously.
