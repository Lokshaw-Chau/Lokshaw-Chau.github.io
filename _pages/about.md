Iâ€™m currently a third-year undergraduate student majored in computer science, Harbin Institute of Technology(Shenzhen). My research interests lie in transfer learning and natural language processing. I will graduate in June 2024 and I am **earnestly** seeking a PhD position for Fall 2024 admission and beyond.
